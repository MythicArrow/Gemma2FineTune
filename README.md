# Gemma2FineTune
This is my fine-tuned Gemma model for the Kaggle contest named Unlocking Global Communication with Gemma.
Here is the link for my Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mythereus/fine-tuning-gemma-2-for-political-turkish
The output model, which has been trained on a dataset with 9000 entries, is also available in the repository.
You can find it here as well. The dataset had been made by ChatGPT.
